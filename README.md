# Reddit Automation Report Dashboard

This repository ships with a lightweight FastAPI application for exploring the
Reddit automation opportunity reports generated by `red.py`.

## Requirements

Install the required packages into your environment (the collector dependencies
remain unchanged):

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn jinja2
```

## Running the dashboard

Launch the development server with auto-reload enabled:

```bash
uvicorn src.ui.report_dashboard:app --reload
```

The root page renders a Jinja2/HTMX shell that hydrates itself by calling the
`/api/reports` endpoint, which serves the parsed contents of `data/report3.json`.
Use the client-side filters to focus on a specific subreddit, automation
complexity, or to search across titles. Toggle the automation assessment chips
to highlight posts that were or were not identified as automation candidates.
