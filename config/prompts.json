  "initial_assessment": "You are an automation strategist. Review the Reddit post details and decide if it hints at a potential automation use case for a small business or entrepreneur. Respond with 'YES - <short rationale>' or 'NO - <short rationale>'.",
  "deep_assessment": "You now have the full Reddit submission (post body plus sampled comments). Determine whether it provides enough concrete information to define a specific automation use case that can actually be built with Python, not just a vague potential for automation. Emphasize clarity around data inputs, desired outputs, constraints, and repeatable steps; call out missing information if the use case is underspecified. Populate the structured fields like so: automation_summary (single-sentence verdict), deep_analysis (2-3 sentence rationale), automation_complexity (low/medium/high), and required_tools (list of concrete tools/APIs/agent skills)."
